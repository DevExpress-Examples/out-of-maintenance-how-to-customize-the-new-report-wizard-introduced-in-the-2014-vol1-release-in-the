# How to customize the New Report Wizard (introduced in the 2014 vol.1 release) in the End-User Designer

We continue to enhance DevExpress-related learning materials/examples on GitHub. Unfortunately, this example lacked user interest and its code base is now obsolete.

If the use-case outlined in this example is of importance to you (or if you require additional guidance), please submit a support ticket via the [DevExpress Support Center](https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/create?followUpTo=T140683). We will be happy to follow-up.
